### Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m Markel. I love software, learning, and sharing.

Iâ€™m into backend engineering, distributed systems, memory management, and high-performance applications. However, I experiment with a lot of different things because Iâ€™m curious and simply like to try and make sense of things.

Iâ€™m still just getting started, but my goal is to become a great software engineer and build amazing technology.

You can find my personal blog on [Medium](https://medium.com/@markelca).
