### Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Markel. I love software, learning, and sharing.

I'm passionate about backend engineering, distributed systems, developer tools, and high-performance applications. However, I experiment with a lot of different stuff because I'm curious and simply enjoy trying to make sense of things.

I'm still just getting started, but my goal is to become a great software engineer and build amazing technology.
